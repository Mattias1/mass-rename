Mass rename
============
A small tool to rename multiple files (or folders).
Best used in combination with a good editor: copy the filenames as plain text,
edit using your favourite text editor and paste it back.

For windows, you can set the vim editor with something like
`MassRename.exe --set-editor "\"C:\Program Files\Vim\vim82\gvim.exe\""`

Setup development environment
------------------------------
Install the dotnet 8 SDK and run with `dotnet run --project MassRename`.
